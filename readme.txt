There are 10,005 pairs of images in this collection. These images are generated using Stable Diffusion 2.1, using the settings described in Section 6 of "Removal Attack and Defense on AI-generated Content Latent-based Watermarking"

The original watermarked image is named "id.png", where id is a number (e.g. 0 or 8123)
The corresponding attacked image is "id_mse_xxx_ssim_yyy.png", where xxx and yyy refers to the pairwise RMSE and SSIM between the original and attacked image, respectively.
